# Password.Generator

## Objective

The goal of the project was to make a password generator using javascript. Using this generator, a user can randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that a strong password will be created for great security.

The password should be able to include or exclude:
    * Lowercase Letters
    * Uppercase Letters
    * Special Characters
    * Numbers


## Usage
When the user clicks generate password, a couple of prompts will pop up. It will go through the length of the password (between 8-128 characters), lowercase letters needed, uppercase letters needed, special characters needed, and numbers needed. Clicking ok will mean to include the character and clicking Cancel will exclude the character. However, at least one of the prompts will need to be included or it will prompt the user to include one of the characters and not generate a password. After going through the prompts, a password will be randomly generated based on the answers off the prompts!
